### Running the Application
Two parts are needed to run concurrently: the Node.js backend and the Vue.js frontend

1. Start the Backend Server: Navigate to your backend folder and run the server. Your API will run on http://localhost:5000.
 - cd backend
 - node server.js

2. Run the Vue.js Frontend:
Open a separate terminal window. Navigate to your frontend folder and start the development server. The application will be running on http://localhost:5173 or a similar port.
 - cd frontend
 - npm run dev

### Development Process â€” AI Usage
Here are examples of how AI (ChatGPT) assisted and how I adapted the outputs:

Example 1 â€” Inline editing in Vue
- *Prompt:* `How to implement inline editing in Vue 3 using contenteditable without text jumping issues?`
- *AI Output:* Suggested using `refs`, setting `innerText` on mount, and updating state with `@input`.
- *My Changes:* Applied it to `titleRef` and `contentRef`, added reset on cancel, and tested typing/deletion for stable behavior.
- *Why:* Fixed the issue where text jumped around after the first letter and gave a smooth inline-edit UX.

Example 2 â€” Tailwind layout
- *Prompt:* `Generate a Tailwind CSS card layout with hover animations.`
- *AI Output:* A card with `rounded-xl`, `shadow-lg`, `hover:shadow-xl`, and gradient background.
- *My Changes:* Reduced animation intensity, adjusted spacing, and matched gradient colors to the app.
- *Why:* The AI design was flashy but too strong for a notes app, so I simplified it for better usability and theme consistency.
